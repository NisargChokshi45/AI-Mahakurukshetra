# Master Task List

## Phase 0 — Foundation

- [x] 2026-03-14 10:19 — Review repo baseline, extract problem statement, and create phased implementation plan
- [x] 2026-03-14 11:50 — Configure `.codex` multi-agent roster from `PRD.md` and `plan.md`
- [x] 2026-03-14 11:57 — Tighten `.codex/agents/*.toml` to minimal, production-ready role profiles
- [x] 2026-03-14 13:03 — Workspace foundation aligned; `pnpm build` passes and dev workflow was confirmed from the already-running user session outside sandbox socket limits
- [x] 2026-03-14 12:12 — Install and configure: Supabase client + SSR auth helpers, Zod, React Hook Form, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui, pino, Vitest, Playwright, Upstash Redis
- [x] 2026-03-14 12:12 — Set up `.env.example` with all required vars (Supabase, Stripe, Redis, app URLs, allowed origins)
- [x] 2026-03-14 12:12 — Configure ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre-commit (lint-staged + type-check)
- [x] 2026-03-14 12:12 — Align framework versions with project conventions or document divergence

- [x] 2026-03-14 13:37 — Fix `pnpm run dev` env loading by sourcing workspace-root `.env` from `apps/web` scripts
- [x] 2026-03-14 15:20 — Fix `pnpm run dev` route conflicts by removing duplicate top-level auth pages and keeping the `(auth)` route-group + `/auth/callback` handler as the single source of truth

## Phase 1 — Product Definition & Architecture

- [x] 2026-03-14 12:25 — Lock route map and page inventory (see `doc/plan.md`)
- [x] 2026-03-14 12:25 — Define and document role matrix: owner, admin, risk_manager, procurement_lead, viewer

- [x] 2026-03-14 12:25 — Confirm feature flag list and which advanced features are gated for MVP

## Phase 2 — Database & Auth

- [x] 2026-03-14 14:58 — Build auth UI surfaces for `/login`, `/signup`, and `/auth/callback` so the planned onboarding flow has visible entry points before Supabase wiring

- [x] 2026-03-14 13:15 — Session refresh middleware, protected dashboard layout, redirect on unauthenticated
- [x] 2026-03-14 13:15 — Org creation on first login; invitation flow for org members
- [x] 2026-03-14 16:21 — Fix first-login org bootstrap failure after email activation by avoiding RLS-blocked `insert().select()` and sequencing membership/config/profile writes
- [x] 2026-03-14 16:25 — Fix post-create redirect loop by resolving Supabase embedded `organizations` relation as object-or-array in auth context
- [x] 2026-03-14 16:35 — Fix cross-tab auth sync so open public tabs (`/`, `/login`, `/signup`) auto-redirect to `/dashboard` after sign-in in another tab
- [x] 2026-03-14 16:38 — Remove logout status querystring redirects so sign-out always routes to `/login` without `?message=...`
- [x] 2026-03-14 18:15 — Fix idle-session logout by awaiting Supabase auth refresh in proxy session middleware before returning response cookies
- [x] 2026-03-14 18:33 — Fix logout navigation: `signOutAction` and new `/logout` route now both sign out and redirect to `/`
- [x] 2026-03-14 13:15 — Write `seed.sql`: 2 demo orgs, 10 suppliers (tiers 1–3), 5 regions, 3 active risk events, 2 open incidents, multiple alerts, contracts, and inventory records

- [x] 2026-03-14 16:11 — Added escalation rule: new `risk_event` impacting more than 3 suppliers now creates a critical triage alert
- [x] 2026-03-14 16:11 — Completed manual risk event ingestion form + server action validation with Zod (`createRiskEventSchema` / `updateRiskEventSchema`)
- [x] 2026-03-14 16:11 — Completed external monitoring webhook ingestion (`POST /api/monitoring`) with HMAC SHA-256 signature verification and UUID org-header validation

- [x] 2026-03-14 14:23 — Supplier detail (`/suppliers/[id]`): profile, risk score breakdown by category, active alerts, assessment history, linked incidents
- [x] 2026-03-14 14:23 — Risk event list (`/risk-events`): filterable by type / region / severity / status, manual ingestion CTA
- [x] 2026-03-14 14:23 — Supply chain map (`/map`): dependency graph (org → tier-1 → tier-2 suppliers), nodes color-coded by risk score
- [x] 2026-03-14 14:23 — Incident board (`/incidents`): kanban-style status columns (new → investigating → mitigating → resolved)
- [x] 2026-03-14 14:23 — Incident workspace (`/incidents/[id]`): timeline, owner assignment, linked risk event, action item checklist, mitigation plans
- [x] 2026-03-14 14:23 — Reports page (`/reports`): list, generate report by type (executive summary, supplier scorecard), export CSV

- [x] 2026-03-14 16:51 — P1: Make risk ingestion writes transactional (event + disruptions + scores + alerts) to avoid partial persistence
- [x] 2026-03-14 17:05 — Unit tests: risk scoring engine, Zod validation schemas, auth utility functions
- [x] 2026-03-14 18:07 — E2E tests: login → dashboard → supplier detail → create incident → resolve incident
- [x] 2026-03-14 18:07 — Verify RLS: user from org A cannot read or write org B data
- [ ] Security checklist: no secrets in client bundle, all mutations require auth, webhooks verify signatures, input validated on every API route
- [ ] pino structured logging on all API route handlers (request ID, user ID, org ID, status, latency)
- [ ] `GET /api/health` returns DB + Redis connectivity, app version, uptime
- [ ] Error boundaries on all dashboard pages with structured error log
- [ ] Swagger docs at `/api/docs` cover all endpoint groups
